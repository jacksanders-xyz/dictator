# WIP
dictator is a library/implementation/HACK that allows neovim to use the bravura font. I don't know if I am going to maintain this quite yet...but we shall see.

pre-requisites:
* install the [bravura font](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura) 
  (instructions on how to do this [here](https://forum.sagittal.org/viewtopic.php?t=429) and [here](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura/blob/master/redist/bravura-text.md))
* enable non-ascii font in your terminal


* make sure white space is enabled in markdown (and, if you are using ultisnips, whitespace is there as well)
